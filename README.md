# Customer Churn Prediction – Case Competition

## Business Problem
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn and identify customers at high risk of leaving so the business can take targeted retention actions.

## Key Results
- Customer engagement variables were stronger indicators of churn than tenure alone.
- Customers with more add-ons and streaming services churned less.
- An XGBoost model performed well at ranking customers by churn risk.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Install required Python libraries
4. Run the notebook from top to bottom
5. Review model outputs and visualizations

## Limitation
This model is predictive, not causal, and results may change as customer behavior changes over time.
