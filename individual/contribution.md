## Individual Contribution

### What did you personally contribute to the most?
I contributed primarily to the feature engineering and business recommendations 
### One decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?
 I advocated for grouping tenure by bins: under 2 years, 2-4 years, and over 4 years. I also wanted to highlight how important customer engagement was compared to every other variable. 
### Lessons learned and improvements
It was overwhelming at first, but I learned alot about running the models, and comparing models to pick the right one.
