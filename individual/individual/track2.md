## Track 2 – How a Recommendation Becomes Reality

### What would be implemented?
The company should implement a targeted retention campaign to focus on customers with low engagement, especially those with few add-ons and streaming services.

### What is the success metric and baseline?
The primary success metric is reducing churn rate among targeted customers compared to the churn rate from the dataset. They should also monitor customer satisfaction and support tickets to ensure retention does not negatively impact customer experience.

### How would you measure impact and what are two risks?
Impact is measured using an A/B test. One group receives the retention intervention and another group does not. Two risks include offering incentives to customers who would not have churned and increasing costs without significantly improving retention.
